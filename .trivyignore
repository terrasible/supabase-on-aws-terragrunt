# Security rule ignores with justifications:

# AVD-AWS-0040: EKS cluster endpoint access from internet
# Ignored because: Temporary configuration for development environment without VPN.
# In production, this should be restricted to VPN or specific IP ranges.
AVD-AWS-0040

# AVD-AWS-0104: Security group rule allows unrestricted egress to any IP address
# Ignored because: EKS node groups require internet access for pulling container images,
# communicating with EKS control plane, and downloading packages. This is standard
# behavior for managed node groups in the terraform-aws-modules/eks module.
AVD-AWS-0104

# AVD-AWS-0178: VPC does not have VPC Flow Logs enabled
# Ignored because: VPC Flow Logs are implemented in our custom networking module,
# but Trivy scans the cached terraform-aws-modules/vpc files which don't include
# our custom flow logs configuration. Our implementation includes CloudWatch logging
# for rejected traffic monitoring.
AVD-AWS-0178
